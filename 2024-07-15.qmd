Does your race or gender affect whether or not you get a callback for an interview in the labor market?

Do stereotypical 'white' names have a higher chance of getting a callback than an African-American sounding name?

Does a more stereotypical 'male' name have a higher chance of getting a callback than a more stereotypical 'female' name?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
file_path <- "data/resume.csv"
data <- read_csv(file_path)

organized_data <- data%>%
  select(name = firstname, call)
```

1st Column: Name
2nd Column: Callback (0/1)
